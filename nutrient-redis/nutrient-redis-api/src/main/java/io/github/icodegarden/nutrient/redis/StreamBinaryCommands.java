	 * messages. Moreover this command, together with XCLAIM is used in order to
	 * implement recovering of consumers that are failing for a long time, and as a
	 * result certain messages are not processed: a different consumer can claim the
	 * message and continue. This is better explained in the streams intro and in
	 * the XCLAIM command page, and is not covered here.

	 * <h1>Returns the messages from a stream within a range of IDs.</h1><br>
	 * 
	 * XRANGE key start end [COUNT count]
	 * 
	 * The command returns the stream entries matching a given range of IDs. The
	 * range is specified by a minimum and maximum ID. All the entries having an ID
	 * between the two specified or exactly one of the two IDs specified (closed
	 * interval) are returned.
	 * 
	 * The XRANGE command has a number of applications:
	 * 
	 * Returning items in a specific time range. This is possible because Stream IDs
	 * are related to time. Iterating a stream incrementally, returning just a few
	 * items at every iteration. However it is semantically much more robust than
	 * the SCAN family of functions. Fetching a single entry from a stream,
	 * providing the ID of the entry to fetch two times: as start and end of the
	 * query interval. The command also has a reciprocal command returning items in
	 * the reverse order, called XREVRANGE, which is otherwise identical.
